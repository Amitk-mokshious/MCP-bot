# 🚫 Cancel Pending ngrok Domain Request

## How to Cancel/Remove the ngrok Domain

### Step 1: Go to Reddit Developer Settings
1. Go to: https://developers.reddit.com/apps/test-mcp1/developer-settings
2. Scroll down to **"Domain exceptions"** section

### Step 2: Remove the ngrok Domain
You have a few options:

**Option A: Delete/Remove Button**
- Look for a **"Delete"**, **"Remove"**, or **"X"** button next to the pending domain
- Click it to remove the request

**Option B: Edit Domain**
- Click **"Edit"** on the pending domain
- Change it to your Railway URL (we'll do this after you get the Railway URL)

**Option C: If No Delete Button**
- You might need to wait for it to be rejected/approved
- Or contact Reddit support to remove it
- **But we can just add the Railway domain alongside it** (multiple domains allowed)
